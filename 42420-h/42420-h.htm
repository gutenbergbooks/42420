<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;So many applications are made to us for histories suited to a period of life when
the mind is beginning to develope its power, and to find satisfaction in connecting the
past with the present and the future in human affairs, that we are induced to recommend
these volumes, which, however widely circulated, have not half the circulation
which they deserve. They are clearly written. They neither minister to childish imbecility,
nor take for granted a measure of knowledge which cannot be lawfully expected
of the young. They present the page of history as it really is&mdash;not a series of dry
details, nor of gorgeous spectacles, but with enough of plain fact to instruct the understanding,
and of romantic incident to kindle the sympathies and affections.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
Observer.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;We have no hesitation in saying, that this is one of the best histories of the Roman
Empire for children and young people which has come under our notice. Mrs. Hamilton
Gray has made herself acquainted with at least some of the more important ancient
writers on the subject of which she treats, and also with the criticisms of Niebuhr and
other modern investigators of Roman history.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;It may be recommended as a clear, rapid, and well-arranged summary of facts,

of the Imperial History, primarily designed for children, but useful for all.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;It would be an erroneous impression to convey of this volume, that it is written
solely for schools and children. In reality it is an abridgment far more likely to be useful
to grown-up persons, who can reflect upon the working of general laws, and make
their own observations upon men and things. A striking characteristic of the book is
the impartiality of its political tone and its high moral feeling.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

of Ram&rsquo;s Episcopal Chapel, Homerton. Fcap. 8vo. cloth, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;This is a thoughtful and valuable book, from an Author advantageously known by
his former publications. It is divided into three parts: the Fatherhood of God Asserted,
the Fatherhood of God Vindicated, the Fatherhood of God Established. There
are phenomena which seem to contradict the notion we are justly taught to form of the
Deity. How are we to understand them? What are we to infer from them? Questions
of this kind have perplexed and distressed many minds. Mr. Griffith considers them
sensibly and scripturally; and we feel convinced that the study of his work will satisfy
many doubts. We are much pleased with the chapter on the toleration of Moral Evil.
There are also some judicious remarks on prayer, the position it holds in regard to
God&rsquo;s assumed immutability. In short, many of the topics now specially exercising
men&rsquo;s thoughts are here well treated.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Church of England Magazine.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;The Divine Fatherhood is the most soul-invigorating and soul-raising of all truths;
whilst practically disregarded by the world, it is often concealed from congregations by
the cloudy dogmas of the pulpit. We gratefully hail, therefore, every attempt of the
pulpit to bring out this grand truth in bold relief before the consciences of men. This
is no commonplace production. Many of the thoughts are strikingly original, the
reasoning is everywhere close and cogent; the illustrations are telling; the style is
pithy and pungent; and the spirit that of a manly and catholic evangelism.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;A volume much wanted, well considered, sufficiently comprehensive to form a

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;This is a valuable work ... the most valuable manual we have on the subject.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
Remembrancer.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;Mr. Moore has succeeded in advancing many principles and suggestions by which
success (in preaching) may be obtained. A work of the kind was wanted.... The various
topics included in the idea of a good sermon are fully discussed, and many admirable
hints are furnished on the parts and arrangements of a sermon,&mdash;on style in relation to
preaching,&mdash;the delivery of a sermon, on extempore preaching, &amp;c.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Journal of Sacred

upon the subject that exists. Mr. Moore writes in a tone of excellent common sense.
Its perusal is almost a duty for the clergy, and will not be without interest for the laity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary
Gazette.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;Mr. Moore is a master in pulpit addresses; his suggestions are therefore entitled to
great attention. We should like to put this volume into the hands of all candidates for
the university, of all young clergymen, and of many old ones too. There is much of wise
observation and judicious admonition in the book. It deserves to be carefully studied.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Church

but who have yet a good deal to learn, will do well to make themselves familiar with
it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p class='posidt'>&ldquo;On all these subjects Mr. Moore treats fully, clearly, and earnestly, and introduces a
great deal of illustration in the way of anecdote, or quotations from various well-known
authors. The book is thus very interesting, apart from the great end it contemplates,
and cannot be read without profit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Clerical Journal.</i></p>
